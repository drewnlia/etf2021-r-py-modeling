<!-- #### need to add the following things -->
<!-- 1. link for this book -->
<!-- 2. do we need to have students pip install anything -->
<!-- 3. Is there a python version we need to have people install? -->

## Topics & Class Structure

1. Overview of modeling
2. Tidymodels (R)  
3. scikit-learn (Python)

## Software Prerequisites

1. R 3.6.x or newer
2. RStudio 1.2.x or newer
3. Python 3.6 or newer
4. scikit-learn 1.0.0 or newer

## Human Prerequisites

We assume you have:

1. A working knowledge of R and RStudio and/or Python;
2. Some experience with contemporary 'tidy' coding concepts;
3. An understanding of modeling principals. 

Let's take an informal poll to see everyone's experience / comfort level with these topics.

Do your best to follow along.  We are happy to answer questions.  This presentation is available here  [MORS ETF  2021](https://dustysturner.com/MORS_ETF_2021/)

## Tutorial Challenges

1. We recognize everyone has different statistical and coding backgrounds.
2. Don't be afraid to ask questions.
3. If you miss something we said, it is likely others have too - you'll be helping them by speaking up.
4. It's difficult to know how we should pace the class, so please communicate!

## End State

1. Students generally understand the modeling process in R and Python;
2. Students have access to resources to learn more.
